21-11-2018-CountingHistories: counting DLT-histories on the caterpillar tree.

06-12-2018-exp1 and 09-01-2019-exp1-redone/:
generating counting data from random species trees
the experiment done on 06/12 used a code that was not sampling species trees uniformly
it was redone with this bug addressed on 09/01

29-01-2019-exp1-redone-2: computing exponential growth in the DL model (MW)

01-02-2019-exp1-ranking: generate 10 rankings for each species tree
and run experiments in the U-DL, U-DLT, R-DL, R-DLT models.

05-02-19-k2: generates results for the species tree with two leaves
(k=2) to estimate the growth constant.
