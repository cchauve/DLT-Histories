Experiment exp1a (11/12/2018)
# We generate trees in a range size (kMin=argv[1],kMax=argv[2])
# For each size we generate nbTrees=argv[3] trees
# The first tree is always the caterpillar
# If k is a power of 2 the second tree is the complete binary tree
# The other trees are random binary trees
# For each tree, we consider it as unranked and then generate nbRankings=argv[4] random rankings
# For each configuration we generate histories in the size range (1,nMax=argv[5])
# We specify the random seed=argv[6] and the output file=argv[7]
