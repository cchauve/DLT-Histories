Experiment exp1a (11/12/2018)
# We generate trees in a range size (kMin=argv[1],kMax=argv[2])
# For each size we generate nbTrees=argv[3] trees
# The first tree is always the caterpillar
# If k is a power of 2 the second tree is the complete binary tree
# The other trees are random binary trees
# For each configuration we generate histories in the size range (1,nMax=argv[4])
# We specify the random seed=argv[5] and the output file=argv[6]

Experiment exp1b (11/12/2018)
# Same but species tree range from 33 to 64 and size of histories goes to 128
