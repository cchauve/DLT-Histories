# DLT-Histories
Counting Duplication/Loss/Transfer Histories

This repository contains the material developed in collaboration with Yann Ponty and Michael Wallner on the problem of counting evolutionary histories in terms of gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene transfers.

The directory src contains the current (evolving) version of the code.
Each exp/ directory contains also a directory src containing the code used for this experiment.
